**Current Status**: Core feature set (settings, slicer, indexing, export, performance tooling) implemented. Focus shifts to consolidation, quality, and forward-looking migration.

---

## 🎯 High Priority

### 1. Standalone Advanced Viewer Wiring ✅ COMPLETED
The advanced (App.vue-driven) standalone mode is now fully functional when visiting `/apps/threedviewer/f/{fileId}`.

**Completed**:
- [x] Added conditional mount in `src/main.js` for `#threedviewer` root
- [x] Pass `fileId`, `filename`, & `dir` via data attributes from template to App.vue props
- [x] Implemented loader-driven model pipeline in both simple (ViewerComponent) and advanced (App.vue) modes
- [x] Added loading / error states harmonized between modes with user-friendly messages
- [x] Documented dual-mode flow in TECHNICAL.md with viewer lifecycle diagram
- [x] Updated PageController to fetch filename and dir from fileId for robustness
- [x] Enhanced error handling with specific messages for 404, 403, network, and parsing errors

### 2. ModelFileSupport / MIME Sync ✅ COMPLETED
Format definitions now centralized in `lib/Constants/SupportedFormats.php`.

**Completed**:
- [x] Created `lib/Constants/SupportedFormats.php` as single source of truth
- [x] Updated `ModelFileSupport` to use centralized constants
- [x] Updated `RegisterThreeDMimeTypes` to use centralized constants
- [x] Updated `UnregisterThreeDMimeTypes` to use centralized constants
- [x] Created unit test (`tests/unit/Constants/SupportedFormatsTest.php`) asserting MIME ↔ validation parity
- [x] All formats synchronized (glb, gltf, obj, stl, ply, dae, fbx, 3mf, 3ds, x3d, vrml, wrl, mtl)

**Note**: Frontend formats in `src/config/viewer-config.js::SUPPORTED_FORMATS` should still be manually verified for consistency.

### 3. Controller & Service Test Expansion ✅ COMPLETED
New controllers (`SettingsController`, `SlicerController`) and services (`FileIndexService`) now have dedicated tests.

**Completed**:
- [x] Unit tests: happy path + error cases for SettingsController
- [x] Unit tests: happy path + error cases for SlicerController (saveTempFile, getTempFile, deleteTempFile)
- [x] Unit tests: happy path + error cases for FileIndexService (indexFile, removeFile, reindexUser)
- [x] Settings round-trip persistence test (getSettings, saveSettings, resetSettings)
- [x] Slicer temp lifecycle test structure (authentication, file validation, share management)
- [x] File index tests (insert, update, folder path extraction, format filtering)

**Note**: Tests created but may need refinement based on actual runtime behavior. Some tests use mocks that may need adjustment for full integration testing.

### 4. Composables Documentation & Cleanup ✅ COMPLETED
Refactored composables lack a consolidated API reference.

**Completed**:
- [x] Created `docs/COMPOSABLES_API.md` with comprehensive API reference
- [x] Verified no residual debug logging (no `console.` statements found in composables)
- [x] Added usage examples (Options API vs Composition API)
- [x] Documented Vue 3 migration considerations and checklist
- [x] Documented all 17 composables with state, computed properties, and methods
- [x] Added best practices and debugging sections

### 5. File Browser List View ✅ COMPLETED
File browser currently only supports grid view.

**Completed**:
- [x] Added list/grid toggle button to FileBrowser component header
- [x] Implemented list view layout with compact rows showing thumbnail, name, size, and date
- [x] Persist view preference in localStorage (`threedviewer:fileBrowserView`)
- [x] Ensured consistent styling between list and grid views using Nextcloud CSS variables
- [x] Added keyboard navigation for list view (Arrow Up/Down, Home, End, Enter, Space)
- [x] View toggle only appears when viewing files (not folders/types/dates overview)
- [x] Added default view setting in Personal Settings (File Browser → Default View)
- [x] FileBrowser now loads and respects default view from user settings
- [x] Updated file grid padding to consistent 20px on all sides

### 6. Cache Management & User Controls ✅ COMPLETED
IndexedDB dependency cache now has full UI controls.

**Completed**:
- [x] Added Personal Settings section: max cache size, max file size, expiration days, enable/disable toggle, clear cache button with live size/count display
- [x] LRU enforcement configurable via user settings (max size merged into VIEWER_CONFIG at runtime)
- [x] Cache hits/misses counts added to performance overlay alongside hit rate
- [x] Privacy considerations documented in TECHNICAL.md (local-only, per-browser, user-controlled)

### 6b. Frontend Format Parity Guard ✅ COMPLETED
Backend and frontend format definitions are now automatically validated.

**Completed**:
- [x] Created `scripts/check-format-parity.mjs` — validates PHP, JS, loader registry, main.js MIMEs, and mimetypemapping.json stay in sync
- [x] Added `npm run format:check` script, integrated into CI (node.yml) and `validate` script
- [x] Fixed missing X3D/VRML MIME registrations in main.js
- [x] Documented the format parity contract and "adding a new format" checklist in TECHNICAL.md

### 6. Security Review: Slicer Temporary Files ✅ COMPLETED
Security audit of slicer temporary file system completed.

**Completed**:
- [x] Confirmed 24h expiry enforced server-side (share expiration + file age check + 6h cron cleanup)
- [x] Validated path sanitization (basename + regex whitelist + path containment check)
- [x] Size limits already enforced: 50 MB per file, 200 MB folder cap, Content-Length pre-check
- [x] MIME validation via finfo sniffing + extension allowlist + heuristic fallbacks
- [x] Comprehensive logging of all operations (user, size, MIME, errors) already in place
- [x] Documented full security posture in TECHNICAL.md
- [x] Fixed OBJ/PLY missing from upload extension allowlist

### 7. Performance Scaling for Large Models ✅ COMPLETED
Implement optional LOD / simplification strategies for very large meshes.

**Completed**:
- [x] Added configurable triangle count thresholds (warn: 500K, strong: 1M faces)
- [x] Implemented automatic performance mode suggestion toast for heavy models
- [x] Made performance mode label clickable in stats overlay to cycle modes
- [x] Made ViewerToolbar performance button cycle through modes
- [x] Added debug logging for performance scaling evaluation
- [x] Integrated with existing performance mode system (auto, low, balanced, high, ultra)

### 8. Vue 3 Migration Pre-Work (Defer Full Migration) ✅ COMPLETED
Lay groundwork to reduce friction later while staying on Vue 2 for now.

**Completed**:
- [x] Eliminated deprecated lifecycle hooks (`beforeDestroy` → `beforeUnmount` in 4 files)
- [x] Added explicit `emits` declarations to all components (ViewerToolbar, ToastContainer, ViewerComponent, ViewerModal, FileNavigation, FileBrowser)
- [x] Verified no implicit `$listeners` usage (none found)
- [x] Added comprehensive migration notes section to COMPOSABLES_API.md with dependency compatibility matrix
- [x] Audited dependencies for Vue 3 compatibility:
  - `vue`: `^2.7.16` → `^3.x` (API compatible, no code changes needed)
  - `@nextcloud/vue`: `^8.33.0` → `^9.x` (requires Nextcloud 30+)
  - Other dependencies: Already compatible or framework-agnostic

### 9. Automated Bundle Budget Enforcement ✅ COMPLETED
Budgets exist informally; enforce via build script.

**Completed**:
- [x] Enhanced size check script with comprehensive budget thresholds for all major bundles
- [x] Script fails CI if budget exceeded (with environment variable overrides)
- [x] Historical size trend tracking (JSON artifact with last 50 entries)
- [x] CI workflow uploads bundle-sizes.json as artifact (90-day retention)
- [x] Size trend comparison shows changes vs previous build
- [x] Improved error reporting with formatted bytes and clear failure messages

### 10. Simple Viewer Parity Enhancements ✅ COMPLETED
Modal viewer now has stats panel, screenshot, and standalone jump.

**Completed**:
- [x] Added lightweight stats panel (meshes, vertices, faces, dimensions) toggle via bottom-right button
- [x] Added screenshot button — downloads PNG of current view
- [x] "Open in 3D Viewer" CTA button already existed (top-right)
- [x] Core loader code already shared via `loadModelByExtension` and `loadModelWithDependencies`

---

## 🔧 Medium Priority

### 11. Multi-File & Dependency Edge Case Test Suite ✅ COMPLETED
Extracted matching logic, wrote 48 unit tests, added edge case fixtures.

**Completed**:
- [x] Extracted pure matching functions into `src/loaders/matchHelpers.js` (texture + file matching)
- [x] 48-test suite covering all 6 texture strategies + 3 file strategies + edge cases (`npm run test:match`)
- [x] Fixtures: mixed-case extensions (`mixed-case.OBJ`), missing MTL (`no-mtl.obj`), orphaned textures (`orphan-texture.obj`)
- [x] Documented matching strategies and fixture matrix in TESTING.md
- [x] Playwright cancel mid-load, retry, network drop scenarios — `tests/smoke/viewer.spec.ts` adds retry-after-cancel (page.route intercepts first fetch and hangs, fulfills on retry) and network-drop (route.abort('failed')); ThreeViewer exposes `window.__LOAD_COMPLETE` and `window.__LOAD_ERROR` test hooks

### 12. Export Functionality Robustness ✅ COMPLETED
Added pre-export validation and corrected MIME types.

**Completed**:
- [x] Added `getGeometryStats()` helper to count vertices/triangles before export
- [x] Toast warnings for large models: >500K triangles (info), >2M triangles (warning)
- [x] Fixed STL MIME type: `application/octet-stream` → `model/stl`
- [x] Fixed OBJ MIME type: `text/plain` → `model/obj`
- [x] Multi-material OBJ edge cases + unit tests for blob creation — `tests/unit/composables/useExport.test.js` covers getGeometryStats (indexed/non-indexed/group traversal) and the full exportAsSTL/OBJ/GLB blob pipeline with mocked Three.js exporters (MIME type `model/stl`/`model/obj`/`model/gltf-binary`, byte length, multi-material mesh passes through with material array + geometry groups intact, null-object guards). Also fixed stale MIME types in SlicerModal.vue (`application/octet-stream` → `model/stl`, `text/plain` → `model/obj`) so the slicer-export path matches the main Export Model path.

### 13. Help Panel & In-App Docs Refresh ✅ COMPLETED
Updated help panel with all new features.

**Completed**:
- [x] Added Slicer & Export section (Send to Slicer, Export Model, Screenshot)
- [x] Added cross-section and exploded view to Tools section
- [x] Added lighting presets, bookmarks, dependency cache to Settings section
- [x] Updated tips with slicer share link and cache config notes

### 14. Internationalization Audit ✅ COMPLETED
Audited and fixed hardcoded strings, updated baseline.

**Completed**:
- [x] Wrapped hardcoded export/error toast strings in `t()` (ThreeViewer.vue export handler, template fallbacks)
- [x] Added 31 new translation keys to `l10n/en.json` (export, cache, modal viewer, help panel features)
- [x] Documented i18n checklist (how to add new strings) in TECHNICAL.md
- [x] Automated string extraction tooling — `scripts/check-i18n.mjs` walks `src/` and `lib/` and extracts every `t('threedviewer', …)` / `this.t(…)` / `->t(…)` call, diffs against `l10n/en.json`, reports missing keys, orphans, and per-locale coverage (including keys left behind after renames). Runs as `npm run i18n:check` (added to `validate` chain) and `npm run i18n:sync` to rewrite `l10n/en.json` from source. Synced en.json closed a 329-string gap plus removed 87 orphans. Non-English translation sync is still manual work — ar/de/es currently sit at ~27% after the gap was closed, surfacing the real coverage picture instead of the previously-inflated number.

### 15. Accessibility Review ✅ COMPLETED
Audited and fixed ARIA roles and keyboard navigation.

**Completed**:
- [x] Added `role="dialog"` + `aria-labelledby` to SlicerModal
- [x] Added `aria-controls` + section IDs to all 6 panel collapsible sections
- [x] Added `aria-label` to emoji-only buttons (screenshot, stats toggle, copy link)
- [x] Added `role="alert"` to texture warning banner in ViewerComponent
- [x] Added `role="region"` + `aria-label` to stats panel with `aria-expanded` on toggle
- [x] Added `aria-label` to share link input
- [x] Focus trap for modals — dependency-free `useFocusTrap` composable wired into SlicerModal + HelpPanel, returns focus to trigger on close, `aria-modal="true"` on dialogs
- [x] Skip-to-viewer shortcut — first-tab-stop link in App.vue, visually hidden until focused, targets `#viewer-wrapper` with `tabindex="-1"`
- [x] High-contrast / forced-colors coverage — Playwright spec emulates `forced-colors: active` and asserts the skip link remains discoverable
- [ ] Future: high-contrast visual audit of toolbars and overlays (sidebar badges, stats panel chips) in actual Windows High Contrast mode
