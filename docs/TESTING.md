## Overview

The 3D Viewer uses a comprehensive testing strategy covering:

- **PHP Unit Tests** - Backend controllers and services
- **JavaScript Tests** - Frontend components and utilities (Jest)
- **End-to-End Tests** - User flows with Playwright
- **Smoke Tests** - Critical functionality verification
- **Bundle Size Monitoring** - Performance budget enforcement

## Test Types

### PHP Unit Tests

Run backend unit tests for controllers and services:

```bash
# Run all PHP tests
composer test:unit

# Run with coverage
composer test:coverage

# Run specific test file
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/unit/Controller/FileControllerTest.php
```

**Test Coverage:**
- Controllers: `FileController`, `ApiController`, `PublicFileController`
- Services: `FileService`, `ShareFileService`, `ModelFileSupport`
- Response builders and validators

### JavaScript Tests

Run frontend tests with Jest (configured in `package.json`):

```bash
# Run all JS tests
npm test

# Run with watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

> **Note**: Jest configuration is defined in `package.json` under the `"jest"` key, using `@vue/vue2-jest` for Vue component testing.

**Test Coverage:**
- Components: Vue components and utilities
- Composables: `useScene`, `useCamera`, `useModelLoading`, etc.
- Loaders: Format-specific loader modules
- Utilities: Helper functions and validators

**Test Files Location:**
- JavaScript tests can be placed alongside source files with `.spec.js` or `.test.js` extensions
- Integration tests in `tests/` directory

### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

Run browser-based integration tests:

```bash
# Run all e2e tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run with browser UI
npm run test:e2e:headed

# View test report
npm run test:e2e:report

# Debug specific test
npx playwright test --debug tests/playwright/viewer-smoke.spec.js
```

**Current E2E Coverage:**
- Viewer smoke test (component mounting, canvas rendering)
- OBJ+MTL loading test
- DRACO compressed glTF test
- Abort loading test

### Smoke Tests

Minimal Playwright tests ensuring critical functionality:

```bash
npm run test:smoke
```

**Smoke Test Coverage:**
- Mount test: Verifies viewer root + WebGL canvas appears
- DRACO compressed glTF test: Exercises conditional decoder wiring
- Abort test: Deterministic slow stream + cancel mid-download

**Current Test Fixtures** (in `tests/fixtures/`):
- `triangle.obj`, `triangle.mtl` - OBJ with materials
- `triangle.glb`, `triangle.gltf` - glTF formats
- `triangle.stl`, `triangle.ply` - Mesh formats
- `triangle-draco.gltf` - Compressed glTF
- `triangle.fbx`, `triangle.3ds`, `triangle.3mf` - Additional formats
- Info files (`.info.txt`) - Metadata about test models

**Adding New Smoke Tests:**

1. Place fixtures under `tests/fixtures/` (keep each <10 KB)
2. Add spec in `tests/smoke/` (TypeScript or JS)
3. Assert emitted DOM events (`threedviewer:model-loaded`, etc.)
4. Use internal static server for throttling if needed

## Bundle Size Monitoring

The viewer enforces bundle size budgets to maintain performance.

### Current Thresholds

| Bundle Pattern | Raw (bytes) | Gzip (bytes) |
|----------------|------------:|-------------:|
| `threedviewer-main.mjs` | 950,000 | 260,000 |
| `gltf-*.chunk.mjs` | 120,000 | 40,000 |
| `FBXLoader-*.chunk.mjs` | 120,000 | 50,000 |

### Running Size Checks

```bash
# Automatic check after build
npm run build
# Runs postbuild hook which includes size check

# Manual check
npm run size:check
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `SKIP_SIZE_CHECK=1` | Bypass size check (avoid in CI) |
| `SIZE_CHECK_SOFT=1` | Exit 0 but print failures (exploratory) |

### When a Bundle Exceeds Limits

1. **Confirm** the diff meaningfully justifies added bytes
2. **Update thresholds** in `scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs` with modest headroom
3. **Add CHANGELOG entry** explaining the increase
4. **Consider alternatives first:**
   - Further code-splitting
   - Conditional dynamic imports
   - Removing unused exports
   - Replacing heavy utilities

### Size Check Script

The script evaluates specific bundle targets and fails in CI if thresholds are exceeded.

**Location:** `scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs`

## Running Tests

### Complete Test Suite

Run all tests (PHP + JS + build + smoke):

```bash
# Using Makefile
make test

# Or manually
composer test:unit
npm test
npm run build
npm run test:smoke
```

### Continuous Integration

The complete CI pipeline:

```bash
make ci
```

This runs:
1. PHP linting and static analysis (Psalm)
2. JavaScript linting (ESLint)
3. PHP unit tests
4. JavaScript tests
5. Build verification
6. Bundle size check
7. Smoke tests

### Pre-Commit Checks

Before committing code:

```bash
# Check code quality
make lint

# Auto-fix issues
make lint-fix

# Run tests
make test
```

## Writing Tests

### PHP Test Example

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace OCA\ThreeDViewer\Tests\Unit\Service;

use OCA\ThreeDViewer\Service\ModelFileService;
use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

class ModelFileServiceTest extends TestCase
{
    private ModelFileService $service;

    protected function setUp(): void
    {
        $this->service = new ModelFileService();
    }

    public function testIsSupportedExtension(): void
    {
        $this->assertTrue($this->service->isSupportedExtension('glb'));
        $this->assertTrue($this->service->isSupportedExtension('gltf'));
        $this->assertFalse($this->service->isSupportedExtension('txt'));
    }
}
```

### JavaScript Test Example

```javascript
import { ModelLoader } from '../src/loaders/ModelLoader';

describe('ModelLoader', () => {
    let loader;

    beforeEach(() => {
        loader = new ModelLoader();
    });

    test('should load model successfully', async () => {
        const mockModel = { scenes: [], animations: [] };
        global.fetch = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({
            ok: true,
            json: () => Promise.resolve(mockModel)
        });

        const result = await loader.loadModel('test.glb');
        expect(result).toEqual(mockModel);
    });

    test('should handle loading errors', async () => {
        global.fetch = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({
            ok: false,
            statusText: 'Not Found'
        });

        await expect(loader.loadModel('invalid.glb'))
            .rejects.toThrow('Failed to load model');
    });
});
```

### Playwright Test Example

```javascript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('viewer loads and displays canvas', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/apps/threedviewer/123');
    
    // Wait for viewer to mount
    await page.waitForSelector('#threedviewer');
    
    // Check for canvas element
    const canvas = await page.locator('canvas');
    await expect(canvas).toBeVisible();
    
    // Verify WebGL context
    const hasWebGL = await page.evaluate(() => {
        const canvas = document.querySelector('canvas');
        return !!canvas.getContext('webgl2');
    });
    expect(hasWebGL).toBe(true);
});
```
