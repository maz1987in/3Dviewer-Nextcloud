# ViewCube Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a ViewCube navigation component for the 3D viewer that displays the current camera orientation and allows users to quickly navigate to standard views.

## Features

### 1. ViewCube Component (`src/components/ViewCube.vue`)
- **Position**: Bottom-right corner of the viewport (centered within its container)
- **Labeled Faces**: Each visible face displays a clear label:
  - TOP (Blue)
  - BOTTOM (Purple)
  - FRONT (Green)
  - BACK (Yellow)
  - LEFT (Orange)
  - RIGHT (Red)
- **Real-time Orientation**: The cube rotates to match the main camera's view orientation
- **Interactive**: Click on any face to animate the camera to that view
- **Responsive**: Adapts size for mobile devices (80x80px) vs desktop (120x120px)

### 2. Integration with ThreeViewer
- Added ViewCube to `src/components/ThreeViewer.vue`
- Integrated camera animation handlers
- Smooth transitions when clicking face labels (1000ms duration with cubic easing)

### 3. Technical Implementation

#### ViewCube Features:
- **Separate Scene & Renderer**: Uses its own Three.js scene and WebGL renderer
- **Orthographic Camera**: Uses orthographic projection for clear view
- **Canvas-based Textures**: Each face uses a canvas texture with text labels
- **Edge Highlighting**: Black edges around the cube for better visual clarity
- **Raycasting**: Click detection using Three.js Raycaster
- **Animation Loop**: Independent animation loop that syncs with main camera rotation

#### Camera Animation:
- **Automatic Distance Calculation**: Calculates optimal viewing distance based on model size
- **Smooth Interpolation**: Uses cubic easing for natural camera movement
- **Target-based Navigation**: Positions camera to face the selected direction

### 4. Styling
- Semi-transparent dark background with backdrop blur
- Rounded corners and subtle border
- Hover effect with scale transform
- RTL (Right-to-Left) support
- Mobile-responsive positioning

## Usage

The ViewCube appears automatically when:
- A model is loaded (`modelRoot` is not null)
- The viewer is not in loading state
- The camera is initialized

### User Interactions:
1. **Visual Orientation**: Watch the cube rotate as you orbit the camera
2. **Quick Navigation**: Click any labeled face to jump to that view
3. **Smooth Transitions**: Camera animates smoothly to the selected orientation

## Files Modified

1. **`src/components/ViewCube.vue`** (NEW)
   - Complete ViewCube component implementation

2. **`src/components/ThreeViewer.vue`** (MODIFIED)
   - Added ViewCube component import
   - Added `handleViewCubeFaceClick` method
   - Added `animateCameraToPosition` helper method
   - Integrated ViewCube into template
   - Fixed face labels implementation conflicts

## Code Quality
- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ Proper TypeScript/JSDoc comments
- ✅ Logging for debugging
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Resource cleanup on unmount
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Accessibility considerations

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Add edge and corner navigation (isometric views)
- Add home/reset button on cube
- Configurable colors and sizes
- Animation speed settings
- Toggle visibility option in toolbar
